    Windows roots are the DOS, anyway.

Date:   2012-07-15

    Retry on UDP sendto() error.
    We should only do that on non-fatal errors only.

    Update ChangeLog, bump version to 0.11

Date:   2012-07-06

    Introduce hostip(8), a tool for resolving a name before dnscrypt-proxy starts.
    It should help fighting the chicken-and-egg issue seen on routers, where
    dnscrypt-proxy requires a working NTP server, but the NTP server requires
    a working resolver.

    chroot() as soon as we can again. Drop libevent2's evdns arc4random() to use
    our chroot()-proof salsa20_random() function instead.

Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: resurrect evdns_set_random_bytes_fn() and add evdns_set_random_init_fn().
    Using the provided RC4 generator is nice, but we maybe want to use something
    else, in particular if we need something that is guaranteed to work in a
    chroot jail, without a /dev/*random device.

Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: don't use memset(<something on the stack>) to securely wipe a buffer,
    because it's prone to compiler optimization.

Date:   2012-06-24

    keep them accessible after chroot(), when reseeding is needed.

    windows: return UV_ENOTSOCK when doing uv_pipe_connect to a file

Date:   2012-03-01

    Windows: we need to zero the loop structure when we initialize it
    or else the ares list of handles is uninitialized and bad things can happen
    when we try to perform async lookups.

    Oh course, there will be no /dev/*random on zindoz.

    The beginning of the end.

Date:   2012-02-24

    *sigh*

Date:   2012-02-23

    There are so many random() calls that having just one hack for Win32 will never fit the bill.

Date:   2012-02-23

    More disgusting changes Windows requires. Not having random()/srandom() is going to be a PITA.

Date:   2012-02-23

    setrlimit() on Win32? LOL.
