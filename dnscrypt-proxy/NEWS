* Version 1.2.0:
 - A pre-filter can now totally bypass the resolver and directly send a
   reply to the client.
 - A new example plugin has been shipped: ldns-aaaa-blocking. It
   directly sends an empty response to AAAA queries in order to
   significantly speed up lookups on hosts without IPv6 connectivity
   (but with clients still asking for AAAA records anyway).
 - Example plugins requiring ldns can be compiled on Windows.
 - Paths with a drive name are now recognized as absolute paths on
   Windows.

* Version 1.1.0:
 - dnscrypt-proxy can now use plugins in order to alter/inspect
   queries and responses before and after they are relayed.
   See README-PLUGINS.markdown for more information.
 - The default max payload size has been trimmed down to 1252 bytes
   for compatibility with some scary network setups.
 - The --local-port and --resolver-port options are gone for good.
   They had been deprecated for a while and were undocumented since
   version 1.0.
 - Multiple certificates are now properly handled.
 - Memory leaks have been fixed, a big bad use-after-free condition
   has been fixed, uninitialized variables have been initialized.
   Upgrading is recommended, especially on Windows.

* Version 1.0.1:
 - dnscrypt-proxy and hostip can now be compiled for Android and
   Solaris.
 - The proxy can now run as a Windows service. The new --install and
   --uninstall command-line switches can automatically register the proxy
   as a service. Startup options are read from the Windows registry.
   See the README-WINDOWS.markdown file for details.

* Version 1.0:
 - Autotools scripts have been improved.
 - 1.0.

* Version 0.12:
 - Datagrams are resent after running out of memory, or if the queue
   was full.
 - Missing compilation flags broke 0.11 on some Linux distributions.
   This has been fixed.

* Version 0.11:
 - A new tool, hostip, can resolve host names before dnscrypt-proxy is
   started. This should help resolving chicken-and-egg problems on
   routers, as reported by LanceThePants.
 - The --local-port and --resolver-port options have been deprecated.
   Please use --local-address=<ip>:<port> and
   --resolver-address=<ip>:<port> instead.
 - Improved stability on Win32.

* Version 0.10.1:
 - The daemon didn't start on some Linux distributions lacking the
   RANDOM_UUID sysctl. This has been fixed.
 - The config.guess files have been patched in order to run out of the
   box on Bitrig.

* Version 0.10:
 - Almost a complete rewrite, with libuv being replaced by libevent.
 - The max number of simultaneous queries is now global, not
   per-protocol.
 - As an insane amount of routers and ISPs are hijacking port 53, the default
   server port is now 443.
 - iOS binaries are now smaller.
 - More dtrace probes.

* Version 0.9.5:
 - Full IPv6 support.

* Version 0.9.4:
 - The --tcp-port option is gone. The resolver port can now be set
   with --resolver-port= and forcing use of TCP can be achieved with
   --tcp-only.
 - portage files for Gentoo have been added.
 - Libuv has been updated.

* Version 0.9.3:
 - Support for native Windows builds.
 - --daemonize has been fixed.

* Version 0.9.2:
 - Support for cross-compilation. In particular, the proxy can now
   compile and work on iOS.

* Version 0.9.1:
 - DNSCrypt should compile out of the box on DD-WRT and other
   uclibc-based systems.

* Version 0.9:
 - libuv has been updated.
 - Enhanced compatibility with non-Intel architectures.

* Version 0.8:
 - Support for Windows (through Cygwin, for now) has been improved.
 - Documentation has been improved.
 - The package now compiles on Dragonfly BSD-current.
 - Signatures are now using ed25519 instead of edwards25519sha512batch.
 - The proxy now compiles on Openwall Linux.
 - Libuv has been updated.
 - A sample .plist file and a Homebrew formula for OSX are now provided.

* Version 0.7:
 - Initial public release.
